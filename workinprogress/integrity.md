## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

### Undergraduates are subject to the honor board but professors may suggest punishment
My standard policy is that any cheating detected results in a zero for the entire assignment. In the case of a major test, this may mean that cheating makes it mathematically impossible to pass the class.

### Learning for Mastery
All students are expected to try to master the material. In an attempt to reduce stress and increase learning, retests are available.

Continued retests are subject to time constraints, and to the
instructor's opinion as to whether a given student is making
sufficient effort to warrant the extra chances.  All students are
expected to try hard on the first test, despite knowing that a retest
is available.
