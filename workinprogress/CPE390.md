## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers data structures and algorithms with emphasis on
implementing algorithms in code and getting them to work.
Students must implement homework in either C++ or Java. On tests, you can write in C++, Java or pseudocode.

This course covers a wide range of topics giving a broad introduction to many areas, rather than in-depth in just a few.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes involve live coding and creation of algorithms. The instructor will ask questions and you are encouraged to actively participate.
* Students are expected to participate and bring laptops to class, and take turns interacting on the screen with the instructor if asked to do so.
* There will be weekly coding homework and/or handwritten assignments.
* Quizzes and tests on paper verify that students know the material they have submitted as homework.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		None. [Notes provided](http://github.com/stevensdeptece/CPE390)
* Other Readings: Papers available in the ref directory of the repository

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for effective learning. Quizzes will be given without notice. These quizzes are for you to learn from, there is no penalty for wrong answers, but not submitting them results in a zero for attendance that day. Please be on time.
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via canvas for individual single files, or via github.
* **Project:**		Depending on the semester, a final project may be substituted for the final.
* **Exams:** There will be two exams and a final.
