# Networking

Data is sent in packets

packet size is determined by physical hardware

802.3 (ethernet)   packet size = 1544 bytes

tcp/ip layer packet size is virtual (I say 64k, it sends smaller packets)
and we get a response (acknowledge) back (telling me message received)

"guaranteed delivery" isn't a guarantee

in small, local networks, you can increase throughput by increasing packet size

Ethernet and WIfi involve random delays between packets
