$V = I*R$

$P=I^2*R = I*V$

$Power = \frac{Energy}{Time}$

Voltage is energy/charge analogous to water pressure

Current is flow analogous to water flow

How does a superconductor work? NO IDEA

$P = 600 * 0.3 = 200W$

$P = 6V * 0.3 = 2W$

$P = 6V * 0.10A = .67W$

$V = L*\frac{di}{dt}$
