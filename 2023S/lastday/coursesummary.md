# Course Summary

## What we have studied

* Computation on current machines
* Von-Neumann Architecture (shared memory used by instructions and data)
* Block devices
* RAM
* A/D and D/A

## Future

* Moore's law is dead, so is Moore
* Room temperature superconductors
* Photonics/Optical computing
* Quantum computers
  - traditional computer: bits are 0 or 1
  - superposition:  bits "wiggle"  qqqqqqqq
  - currently ~400 qbits
* Adiabatic computer
* DNA gates
