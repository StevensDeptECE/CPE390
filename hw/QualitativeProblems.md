# Qualitative Problems

1. If you double the clock speed of a microprocessor but the memory speed remains unchanged, explain the kind of computation that gets faster and the kind that doesn't.

1. Memory that claims to have a certain bandwidth may be somewhat misleading. This definition is for what type of memory accesses?

1. Explain how the div instruction on the x86 epitomizes CISC architecture.

1. Explain the advantages and disadvantage of a 3-operand instruction. Why does ARM use this? Why does Intel largely use 2-operands?

1. If 64-bit processors are better, why might we want to use an 8-bit processor in a thermometer or in the anti-lock braking system of your car? Explain the design concerns for the two example applications (thermometer, ABS-brakes).

1. Is a computer with 4 cores 4 times faster than a computer with 1 core? Is 8 twice as fast as 4?

1. Is a 64-bit computer twice as fast as a 32-bit computer? Explain.

1. Pick a fast DDR5 RAM on newegg.com
   * Show the URL
   * Show the number of gigabytes
   * specify the price when you looked
   * Determine the number of clock cycles until a first read is returned
   * Determine the number of reads available in a burst
   * Determine the page size
