# Group Homework: Explain Computer

Draw your own diagrams of the following:
1. Generic block diagram of a computer showing
   * CPU
   * ALU
   * registers
   * decode logic
   * address bus
   * data bus
   * RAM
   * ROM
   * cache

1. Specific block diagram of an x86 CPU showing:
   * L1, L2, L3 cache
   * registers indicating names
   * barrel shifter
   * integer unit
   * floating point unit (vector registers)

1. Diagram of the latest Intel CPU showing
   * Model number
   * clock speed
   * boost clock speed
   * Draw cores as rectangles (label performance and E-cores)
   * L1, L2, L3 cache with sizes if you can find it
   * Show how the caches are shared between cores
Research: 

1. Diagram of a stack showing how functions are called.
   For example, show main() calling f(), f() calling g()

1. table showing process memory strcture for a linux computer. Where is the code, the global variables, the stack, the heap.

Treasure hunt: Try to find diagrams of as many of the following as possible. For each, find the wattage, and number of transistors.
1. die layout of original Intel 4004
1. die layout of latest AMD monster
1. die layout of latest Apple M??
1. label at least one of these diagrams showing key areas. (cores, cache, I/O)
1. Draw a diagram showing comparative sizes of each CPU above.

<!--
ignore this
1. Find the latest Intel and AMD CPU and compare the following specs
   * clock frequency
   * boost clock frequency
   * number of cores (and see whether they are all the same)
   * amount of cache (breakdown into L1,L2,L3 if possible)
   * memory bandwidth in gigabytes/sec
