## HELP AVAILABLE

If you have questions about any material in this course, you may contact the TA, or me.
My preferred mode of remote help is discord but if you have problems with that zoom is fine.
Hours are posted in my [office hours](http://bit.ly/3n1TA2L)
There are also paid peer mentors who are available, but depending on the course, a given peer mentor might not know everything you are learning. They are always excellent students, try and ask!

You may make an appointment with me for in-person meetings, but please don't assume that I will be in the office unless you make that appointment.

## LEARNING ACCOMODATIONS

It is the policy of this instructor to require all students entitled
to learning accommodations to take a first test in regular time.
Students are expected to use this to learn how the tests are
conducted, to identify their weaknesses in knowledge are so they can
improve their performance.  Note that these assessments are designed
with far more than enough time.  The difficulty is when students do
not really know the material, which is why this course allows
retesting.

Students entitled to extra time may have that time when retesting if
they need it.

Note that this policy is in accordance with the law. You are entitled
to extra time, but even if it is stressful, I am entitled to ask you
to take the first test in regular time provided I give you the
opportunity to retest with extra time.

If you have any questions about the
legality, please contact Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability
Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at
pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.

## INCLUSIVITY 

### Name and Pronoun Usage

As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes.

### Inclusion Statement

Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements.

You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.

## MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health.  While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health.  The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression).  Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216-5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.

In the event of an urgent or emergent concern about the safety of yourself or someone else in the Stevens community, please immediately call the Stevens Campus Police at 201-216-5105 or on their emergency line at 201-216-3911.
