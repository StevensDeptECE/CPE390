* 2023 Spring
* **Instructor:**  [Dov Kruger](bio.md)
* **[Meeting Times and Office hours](officehours.pdf)
* **[Resources](resources.md)**
* **[Course Web Address](https://github.com/stevensdeptece/CPE390)**

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers how computers work (computer architecture) and using microcontrollers to interact with their external environment (embedded systems).

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to
* Use a knowledge of how microprocessors work to reduce errors or to know how some of the major problems that can occur
  * Overflow
  * Roundoff
  * Memory faults
* Use a knowledge of how compilers and microprocessors work to write programs that are more efficient
  * Access Memory sequentially where possible
  * Use cache efficiently to avoid memory accesses
  * Know when the compiler will not be able to optimize and do it manually
* Read and write digital voltagese
* Use power transistors and H-bridge controllers to drive motors
* Use A/D and D/A converters to interact with the analog world
* Practice a little using oscilloscopes
* Record your designs using a CAD package
* Optionally learn to use git to work in teams effectively.
* Use a CAD package to draw hardware designs.
* Use LTSpice to analyze simple hardware designs.	


## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes involve live coding demonstrations, you are encouraged to join in sometimes using vscode.
* The instructor will ask questions and you are encouraged to actively participate.
* There will be weekly coding homework and/or handwritten assignments.
* Quizzes and tests on paper verify that students know the material they have submitted as homework.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		none. Notes provided.
* Other Readings: 	Papers available in ref directory

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance:**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. Your work will speak for itself.
* **Homework:** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via canvas for individual single files, or via github.
* **Project:**		Depending on the semester, a final project may be substituted for the final.
* **Exams:** 	 	There will be two exams and a final.

## GRADING PROCEDURES
Grades will be based on:
* Programming Assignments             (15 %)
* Homework Assignments	              ( 5 %)
* Quizzes                             ( 0 %)
* Labs	   		              (20 %)
* Exams		              	      (80 %)
