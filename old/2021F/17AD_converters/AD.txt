int v = analogRead(A0); // what if value were 1-bit?
// 0 = 0V   1 = Vcc = 5V

 2bit

 00    0V
 01    1.666V
 10    3.333V
 11    5V

Arduino = 10bits 0..1023
Arduino Due 12 bits 0..4095     3.3V   resolution = 3.3V/4096
you can set the reference voltage = 1.1V IN SOFTWARE

you can also define reference voltage externally

Amplifier? what is the effect? like a microscope


analogy ruler: 1/16"
analogy to higher number of bits for A/D --> using finer lines


Electronics (photoresistors) is not instaneous
A/D Arduino $3  7700 samples per second s/s
Due $16 84Mhz 1Ms/s

speed = 1Gs/ s   8-bit

resolution = meaningful 24 bits

one-wire
SPI = 5Mbps 4-wire, simple   5Mb/24 = 
I2C = 200kbps
Canbus

limitations: how fast the A/D converter works
how fast the data can be transmitted to the CPU

If we are measuring a variable we have to consider not only the A/D converter
but the circuit measuring the other variable
