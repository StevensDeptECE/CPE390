T = 1/f each clock period = 1/1.5billionth of a second 2/3ns

how far does light travel in 1ns? 1ft
latency
	1. shrink the computer (bring closer together)
	2. send asynchronously (don't wait)
having a master clock to synchronize is faster


1Gb, 2Gb - 8Gb

4Gb = 2**32
every address on the machine = 32 bits

64-bit operating system, every address = 64 bits

0x000000007FFF2414

why 64-bit?
AARCH64 has	ARM A72

1. division  --> call a function
2. hardware acceleration for encryption
3. other specialty instructions
4. Anyone with a Mac using M1 chip can program on that.
5. NEON vector engine 128-bit    2 double multiply-add
