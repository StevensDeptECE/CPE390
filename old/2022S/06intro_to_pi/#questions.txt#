1. Explain the difference between the von Neumann architecture and the Harvard architecture.

2. Since ARM (like most computers) uses a von Neumann architecture, explain how Instruction cache (Icache) and Data caching (D-cache) make the computer faster. How much Icache and Dcache does the Raspberry pi have?

3. How fast is accessing L1 cache vs. L2 cache?
