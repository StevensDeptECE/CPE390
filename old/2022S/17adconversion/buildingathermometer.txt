1. Build voltage divider.
2. Figure out known "ground truth"
need existing thermometer
what about the temperature you measure not being the same place as the new thermometer you are building?
 a. Insulate the test container
 b. Use a material that has a high heat capacity
 c. Use a known temperature material ice bath
 d. water has SALT in it
 e. voltage changes, sensor probably isnt the same
 f. observer principle: by measuring something, we change it
 g. the voltage of the power supply will affect the A/D converter
 h. changes over time? UGH!

3. What is a different kind of sensor that would heat the water less?
